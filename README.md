This is a project for Kaggle titanic competition ([competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)).

Accuracy is tested based on submitted Prediction file, mine has 0.77272 accuracy at best, I'm still tweaking the features and choosing the right model.

Current version with Logistic Regression as model classifier scores 0.73684, but I'll be hypertuning it soon. I'm hoping to get past 0.8 to be content with my work.
