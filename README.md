This is a project for Kaggle titanic competition ([click here if You're curious](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)).

Competition is about predicting, based on set of train data, wheter a person will or will not survive Titanic sinking. In this project  I'll be cleaning, adding and adjusting data as well as choosing the right model.
Accuracy is tested based on submitted Prediction.csv file, mine has 0.77272 accuracy at best, I'm still tweaking the features and choosing the right model.

Current version with added features and Logistic Regression as model classifier scores 0.73684, but I'll be hypertuning it soon. I'm hoping to get past 0.8 to be content with my work.
